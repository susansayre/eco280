## Submission details

You will submit this assignment by pushing a PDF of your literature review to your lit-review-gitusername repo by 10:30am EST on Wed Oct 7. Although not strictly required, it is highly recommended that you also push the sourcefile (e.g. a .docx or .Rmd file) unless you wrote your lit review in Google Docs.

There are several intermediate deadlines associated with this paper including:

- Wed Sep 16: Literature search description
- Wed Sep 23: Single article summary
- Mon Sep 28: Mini-presentation of thematic grouping of your articles

While the other elements should be written independently, you are welcome to work in groups of up to 3 students on the literature search if there are other students interested in similar topics. As you search the literature the first time, it can be quite helpful to have collaborators to check in with. If you work in a group, each group member should write a summary of a different article and develop their own grouping of the literature.

## **What** I want you to do

Write a synthetic review of the economic literature on a topic of your choosing.

## **Why** I want you to do it

This assignment is designed to help you develop the following skills:

- Using EconLit, Google Scholar and other databases to effectively search the literature to identify what economists have learned about a topic you are interested in
- Skimming papers quickly and effectively to decide which may be of interest
- Understanding the basic story in an economics paper that may contain many specialized elements or large amounts of jargon
- Identifying themes and connections between different papers
- Writing about economic literature using a scholarly voice and tone consistent with general practice in economics

## **How** I want you to do it

### Guidelines

- Your paper should be between 1000 and 1800 words. I recommend targeting roughly 1500 words. If you have a large number of papers to talk about and feel that you need to exceed 1800 words, you  may do so, but please edit your paper carefully for wordiness before submitting a paper longer than 1800 words.

- You should aim to discuss roughly 8-15 papers. You must discuss a minimum of 5 papers but adequately addressing the literature on most topics will require considering more papers than this. You do **not** need to provide in-depth discussions of all of the papers, although you need to read them enough to know how they fit in the literature. You will generally be focusing on the big picture of each paper: what was their research question, how did they answer the question, and what did they find? For some papers, you may only need a couple sentences to describe this.

- Your paper should have the following sections:

    * An introduction that describes why the topic is of interest and develops a thesis about the state of the economic literature on the topic. This can be relatively short but should preview the main body of the paper. Your reader should understand roughly what economists have to say on your topic after reading the introduction.
    
    * A body that includes several sections describing different strands of the literature on your topic. One of your main tasks is to decide what the appropriate themes are for grouping the literature on your topic. This is not necessarily a "right" answer to this questions. Common ways of grouping the literature include by method, by finding, or by sub-topic. You should pick one primary way to group the literature and include sections in the body of the paper that illustrate the main groups you're considering. If there are secondary groupings that you think are also important, you are free to include sub-sections with each of your main groups or draw these connections in your writing.
    
    * A conclusion that summarizes the main findings and offers some suggestions on where the field might go in exploring your topic. You might talk about some (but not necessarily all) of the following: major unanswered questions, possible approaches to resolving disagreements in the literature, opportunities to use new methods to address the topic. This section can be short.
    
- Use author-date in-text citations and a consistent bibliography format (APA or similar)

- Consider writing your paper in RMarkdown and/or using .bibtex to produce your bibliography.

## Grading Rubric

- **A/A-**: Papers in this category synthesize most of the key literature on their topic, identifying key themes and controversies within the literature. In doing so, the paper makes an argument about what the literature does or does not tell us and provides evidence in support of that argument. Discussion of the papers focuses on what we can learn from the literature as whole. Papers are described accurately in scholarly language like that used in the sample papers. Intermediate deadlines met consistently.

- **B+**: Papers in this category share many features with those in the A categories, but also have some weaknesses. They may miss a couple particularly important papers or lean more toward description of the literature as opposed to synthesis. Alternatively, the paper may make a strong argument but provide less careful evidence in support of that argument. Language or tone may be less appropriate for an academic paper. Most intermediate deadlines met on time.

- **B/B-**: Papers in this category may have individual strong features but lack a clear argument. The paper may read like an annotated bibliography, reporting on the conclusions of a series of papers without making adequate connections between the papers or offering analysis of the state of the literature. The paper may miss important parts of the literature or mischaracterize some of the findings. Language may be more conversational than academic. Intermediate deadlines may not have been met consistently.

- **C+ or below**: Papers in this category have significant weaknesses as an academic literature review. They may engage only a small number of papers or make an argument about the literature that is unsupported by the evidence. Alternatively, they may fail to include any synthesis across topics. Several intermediate deadlines may have been missed or late.

## Intermediate Products

As noted above, there are several intermediate deadlines associated with this project to help keep you on track. Intermediate products will not be graded, but completing them on time will contribute to your overall literature review grade.

### Literature search description

**Submit** to your GitHub repo by Wed 9/16

Using a mix of Google Scholar and EconLit, search the economic literature on a topic of your choosing. Write a brief summary of your literature search in an RMarkdown document and push it to your GitHub lit-review repo (as described in [HW 1](https://eco280smith.netlify.app/materials/homework/hw1-git-basics/#initialize-your-lit-review-repo)). You should describe the search terms you used, how you traced papers, etc and provide bibliographic information for the papers that seemed interesting/relevant. You should **not** provide a complete list of all articles that a particular search term returned unless it was a small number of papers and you deemed all of them relevant. If particular search terms you used returned a very large number of results or primarily returned papers on unrelated topics, note that in your description and describe how you adapted. 

When searching the literature, you should start with a couple keywords you think are interesting and then adapt based on what you find. It often takes a little while to narrow in on the jargon and phrases economists use for particular topics and to adapt your topic enough to find something that economists have written about enough. Once you have a couple papers that sound interesting, try **tracing backwards** (e.g. looking at their literature reviews and reference sections to see who they cited). Then try **tracing forwards**. [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com) is great for this because it is easy to see who has cited a paper. Papers with more citations are more influential, although the publication date of the paper is important here.

While you should include mostly published, peer-reviewed journal article, economics is somewhat unusual as a discipline in that working papers are often cited as well.

### Single article summary

**Submit** to your GitHub repo by Wed 9/23

Using RMarkdown, write 200-300 page summary of one of the articles you located in your literature search. Note that this summary will be more detailed than the discussion you will include in your literature review for most of the papers you discuss. Writing the summary is designed to give you practice in digesting economic journal articles, which are often quite dense.

Begin by screening the articles you have located by reading the abstract and potentially skimming the introduction. As you read, decide how interesting and relevant you think the article will be for understanding your topic of interest. Pick an empirical article (one that uses statistical analysis to answer a research question) that sounds especially interesting to you.

Work through the steps in the [Abstract, Introduction, Conclusion (AIC)](https://eco280smith.netlify.app/materials/activities/aic-method) activity to help you determine what the article is about and what the authors found. You do **not** need to answer all of the questions in your single article summary, but thinking through them will help you write a good summary.

Once you've done this, you should write a 200-300 word summary of the article (more than this is ok, but probably not necessary). In the summary, you should primarily be focused on answering the questions in [Step 7](https://eco280smith.netlify.app/materials/activities/aic-method/#step-7-summarize-your-findings) of the AIC activity. 

### Mini-presentation

Live in class on 9/28 or 9/30 **or** recorded and shared with the class before class on 9/30

You will make a brief presentation either live in class or recorded asynchronously and shared with class. In this presentation, you will use a couple slides to describe what you've discovered about the economic literature on your topic. Presentations/videos should be 3-5 minutes long. 

A key element of the presentation is identifying one or more ways to group the articles thematically. As discussed above, thematic groupings can be organized in a number of different ways including: by method, by finding, or by sub-topic.
