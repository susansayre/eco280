## Submission details

You will submit this assignment by pushing a PDF of your literature review to your lit-review-gitusername repo by 10:30am EST on Wed Oct 7. Although not strictly required, it is highly recommended that you also push the sourcefile (e.g. a .docx or .Rmd file) unless you wrote your lit review in Google Docs.

There are several intermediate deadlines associated with this paper including:

- Wed Sep 16: Literature search description
- Wed Sep 23: Single article summary
- Mon Sep 28: Thematic grouping of papers
- Mon Sep 28 or Wed Sep 30: Mini-presentation

## **What** I want you to do

Write a synthetic review of the economic literature on a topic of your choosing.

## **Why** I want you to do it

This assignment is designed to help you develop the following skills:

- Using EconLit, Google Scholar and other databases to effectively search the literature to identify what economists have learned about a topic you are interested in
- Skimming papers quickly and effectively to decide which may be of interest
- Understanding the basic story in an economics paper that may contain many specialized elements or large amounts of jargon
- Identifying themes and connections between different papers
- Writing about economic literature using a scholarly voice and tone consistent with general practice in economics

## **How** I want you to do it

### Guidelines

- Your paper should be between 1000 and 1800 words. I recommend targeting roughly 1500 words. If you have a large number of papers to talk about and feel that you need to exceed 1800 words, you  may do so, but please edit your paper carefully for wordiness before submitting a paper longer than 1800 words.

- You should aim to discuss roughly 8-15 papers. You must discuss a minimum of 5 papers but adequately addressing the literature on most topics will require considering more papers than this. You do **not** need to provide in-depth discussions of all of the papers, although you need to read them enough to know how they fit in the literature. You will generally be focusing on the big picture of each paper: what was their research question, how did they answer the question, and what did they find? For some papers, you may only need a couple sentences to describe this.

- Your paper should have the following sections:

    * An introduction that describes why the topic is of interest and develops a thesis about the state of the economic literature on the topic. This can be relatively short but should preview the main body of the paper. Your reader should understand roughly what economists have to say on your topic after reading the introduction.
    
    * A body that includes several sections describing different strands of the literature on your topic. One of your main tasks is to decide what the appropriate themes are for grouping the literature on your topic. This is not necessarily a "right" answer to this questions. Common ways of grouping the literature include by method, by finding, or by sub-topic. You should pick one primary way to group the literature and include sections in the body of the paper that illustrate the main groups you're considering. If there are secondary groupings that you think are also important, you are free to include sub-sections with each of your main groups or draw these connections in your writing.
    
    * A conclusion that summarizes the main findings and offers some suggestions on where the field might go in exploring your topic. You might talk about some (but not necessarily all) of the following: major unanswered questions, possible approaches to resolving disagreements in the literature, opportunities to use new methods to address the topic. This section can be short.
    
- Use author-date in-text citations and a consistent bibliography format (APA or similar)

- Consider writing your paper in RMarkdown and/or using .bibtex to produce your bibliography.

## Grading Rubric

- **A/A-**: Papers in this category synthesize most of the key literature on their topic, identifying key themes and controversies within the literature. In doing so, the paper makes an argument about what the literature does or does not tell us and provides evidence in support of that argument. Discussion of the papers focuses on what we can learn from the literature as whole. Papers are described accurately in scholarly language like that used in the sample papers.

- **B+**: Papers in this category share many features with those in the A categories, but also have some weaknesses. They may miss a couple particularly important papers or lean more toward description of the literature as opposed to synthesis. Alternatively, the paper may make a strong argument but provide less careful evidence in support of that argument. Language or tone may be less appropriate for an academic paper.

- **B/B-**: Papers in this category may have individual strong features but lack a clear argument. The paper may read like an annotated bibliography, reporting on the conclusions of a series of papers without making adequate connections between the papers or offering analysis of the state of the literature. The paper may miss important parts of the literature or mischaracterize some of the findings. Language may be more conversational than academic.

- **C+ or below**: Papers in this category have significant weaknesses as an academic literature review. They may engage only a small number of papers or make an argument about the literature that is unsupported by the evidence. Alternatively, they may fail to include any synthesis across topics.
