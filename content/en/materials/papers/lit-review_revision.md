## Timeline and logistics

Revising your literature review is entirely optional. You are not required to do so. If you do revise the paper, I will substitute your revised grade for your original grade. There are two important caveats:

- The standards will be (a little bit) higher for the revised versions than they were for the original papers, particularly on details like those addressed in the general feedback below.
- I will not lower your grade unless there are academic honesty or plagarism concerns with the revised version, in which case I do reserve the right to lower your grade for the assignment.

Revisions should be submitted by Monday, December 7. To submit a revision, push the revised version to your lit review git repo **and** send me an email letting me know that you have submitted a revised version.

## Common suggestions for improvement

In addition to the specific comments on your submission, there were a few suggestions that apply to many of the papers. Please look these over and consider whether they apply to you.

- Your introduction should include a summary of what you specifically say in the body of your papers. That is, you should tell us in the introduction what the different categories you'll discuss are and ideally, summarize the main messages from the strands of the literature. The idea is that someone should be able to get the basic message from the introduction -- neither economics papers nor literature reviews are mystery novels. For instance, working with my carbon tax example, I might conclude the introduction with a paragraph like this:

> This literature review discusses three major questions addressed by the literature: (1) are carbon taxes regressive, (2) how do different methods of revenue recycling affect regressivity; and (3) how do impacts vary across other (non-income) dimensions. On the first question, the literature suggests that the consumption effects of carbon taxes are regressive, but that when income sources are considered, the overall effect is less regressive and may even be progressive. On the second question, the literature emphasizes that the method of recycling the revenue is critical and that there may be a trade-off between equity and efficiency. On the final question, the literature concludes that regional variation is significantly smaller than income variation. It also finds that idiosyncratic within group variation is larger than between group variation.

- Pay attention to the language used to describe papers in your literature review. Economists have a particular style that may differ from other disciplines. Although you may find some exceptions in individual papers, generally speaking your descriptions should follow the following guidelines:

    * Common verbs for describing what authors do: study, investigate, argue, find, conclude, demonstrate, suggest, speculate, imply, infer. Note the different connotations of these words and pick one that matches what you are saying about the author in a particular sentence. As an example, we might say something like "Smith and Young (2015) investigate prison reforms" but we'd be more likely to say "Smith and Young (2015) find that a specific law reduced arrests by 15%". We tend to reserve the word "prove" for proofs in a theoretical model: e.g. "Smith and Young (2015) prove that there is a unique equilibrium in their model." It should generally not be used for statistical results since statistics cannot **prove** whether something is true or not.
    * The authors, rather than the papers, are the "actors" in your sentences: "Smith and Young (2015) describe" rather than "Smith and Young's 2015 paper describes." Paper titles or descriptions are generally not used. (One exception: economists will sometimes indicate in the text when a result is from a working paper by saying something like "In a recent working paper, Smith and Young (2015) argue..." or "preliminary results from Smith and Young (2015) suggest that ..." This is not universal and it is ok if you do not do this since your references will demonstrate that the paper is a working paper).
    * Because the authors are the actors, the verbs should be either singular or plural depending on the number of the authors.
    * Analysis is usually described using present tense verbs: "Smith and Young (2015) demonstrate" rather than "Smith and Young (2015) demonstrated."
    * First names or initials should not be used in references. If you are unsure about what portion of an author's name is their last name, look for clues in the following places: (1) Do they cite another one of their own papers? This is fairly common and the way they refer to themselves in a citation will give you a hint? (2) Do they use last names in the footer on the first page describing author affiliations or list an email address? (3) Have other papers cited this one yet? What name do they use?
    * It is (perhaps unfortunately) common to refer to the authors of single-authored papers as he or she in subsequent references. In many cases, this may be because the author of the current paper knows the person they are citing (academic circles, particularly within certain fields, are relative small). Unless you are sure of an author's pronouns, I would prefer that you avoid using pronouns to refer to single authors and simply repeat their (last) name in subsequent mentions.
