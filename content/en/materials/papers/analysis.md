Working alone or in a pair, you will create and document an analysis of a dataset of your choosing. Your analysis should include a careful description of the dataset and the individual variables, a discussion of the summary statistics of the dataset with a focus on understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the data for answering questions, one or more graphs illustrating the data, and a regression using some or all of the data. You will discuss what the regression can and cannot tell you, but are **not** required to identify a regression technique that allows you to make causal claims about a research question.

Deadlines:
- Mon 11/30: Push data and import code to project repo
- Mon 12/7: Push interim progress update
- Thurs 12/17: Push final project with working computer code

Additional details will be posted here when we begin the assignment.
