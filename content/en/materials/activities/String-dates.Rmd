In class today, we will be working with string and date functions using two example files.

- [Metadata for HW5 data file](/docs/ACSDT1Y2019.B02001_metadata_2020-10-09T060941.csv)
- [Example transaction time data](/docs/transaction_dates.csv)

Please create a folder on your computer for this activity and download these two files to a data folder inside your project folder.
