In class today, we will be working with string and date functions using two example files.

-   [Metadata for HW5 data file](/docs/ACSDT1Y2019.B02001_metadata_2020-10-09T060941.csv)
-   [Example transaction time data](/docs/transaction_dates.csv)

Please create a folder on your computer for this activity and download these two files to a data folder inside your project folder.

For reference, you can download the [code created during class](/docs/strings_and_dates.Rmd) today to compare with your own work. The class recording can be accessed with the info on [this Slack post](https://smi-eco280-02-202101.slack.com/archives/C019JD2AK7H/p1602701266000800)
