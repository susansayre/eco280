This template is designed to help you extract basic information about an
article without reading the (often dense) middle sections of the paper.
It concludes with suggestions on how you might dive into the detailed
sections if you need to.

Step 1: Read the abstract and answer the following questions:
-------------------------------------------------------------

-   What question does the paper address?
-   What methodology/data does the paper use?
-   What are the paper’s main conclusions?
-   Do any questions come to mind as you read the abstract?
-   (Is this paper relevant to me/this project?)
-   List/circle any unfamiliar terms whose meanings seem important to
    understanding the article.

Step 2: Read/skim the introduction
----------------------------------

-   Revisit the earlier questions. Do you have any additions/changes to
    your answers based on the introduction?
-   What has previous literature on related questions found?
-   What is new and different about this study relative to the previous
    literature?
-   What are the main sections of the paper (if described)? Which of
    these sound like they will be helpful to you? Which do you think
    will be understandable?
-   (Often relevant for empirical papers) What statistical or
    econometric issues is the paper concered about? How did they address
    these concerns?
-   List/circle any unfamiliar terms whose meanings seem important to
    understanding the article.

At this point, consider google searches or asking me if there are terms
you want to understand before proceeding.

Step 3: Skip the middle of the paper and read the conclusion
------------------------------------------------------------

Note that the conclusion is very short in many economic papers.

-   Revisit all the earlier questions. Do you have any additions/changes
    to any of your earlier answers?
-   What is the paper’s take away message?
-   What are the limitations/exceptions to the paper’s conclusion?
-   What will be most critical for you to read/understand/assess to
    decide whether you agree with the paper’s conclusions?
-   List/circle any unfamiliar terms whose meanings seem important to
    understanding the article.

Step 4: Assess and possibly continue
------------------------------------

For many of the papers you will discuss in your literature review, you
can stop here (or even earlier). As a general rule, it’s worth stopping
after each section and considering whether it’s worth continuing. If I’m
really interested in a paper, at this point, I usually proceed with the
remaining steps.

Step 5: Flip through (but don’t read yet) the remaining sections.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

For each section, answer the following questions:

-   What is the purpose of the section?
-   How specialized does the terminology, methodology seem?
-   If you needed to rely on the paper, would you plan to read in
    detail, skim, or skip this section? Why?

Step 6: Read/skim/skip sections according to your plan:
-------------------------------------------------------

-   Do you find the paper credible? Why or why not?
-   What critiques do you have of the paper, the methodology, the
    conclusion, etc?

Step 7: Summarize your findings
-------------------------------

-   What are the paper’s main findings?

    *Note:* Be careful to consider the difference between the specific
    results of the study and any broader applicability that the authors
    claim.

-   What techniques did the author(s) use to reach these findings?

-   What are the important take-aways from the paper *for you*?
