## Section 1:

he paper appears. You do *not* need to summarize the papers themselves but should bring a copy of the one you are most interested in to class.
        - Reading skills: abstract, introduction, and conclusion; focused reading of data and methods
        - Construct a summary of one of your articles (due before class next Wednesday)
    
- Classifying the literature
- Literature presentations  

    + Final literature review due next Wednesday

## Section 2: Reproducible research

In this part of the course, we focus on developing good practices for reproducible research. You work will consist of a mix of homework exercises and interim progress checkpoints o7n your group project to reproduce the analysis in an existing economic journal article. I will provide a list of suggested articles to reproduce.

- Organization

    + File and folder structure
    + Relative paths, collaboration with others
    + Storing raw data
    + Data manipulation with code
    
- Data wrangling

    + Creating new variables from existing ones (mutate, gen)
    + Computing summary statistics by group (summarize, collapse)
    + Reorganizing data (pivot, reshape)
    + Merging data from different sources (xxx_join, merge)
    
    Key point: Before you start to write code, first determine what your data looks like now **and** what you want it to look like. Then plan the steps you need to get from one to the other.
    
- Working with strings and dates  
- Implementing regression methods with code
- Creating output with code

## Section 3: Understanding your data

In this part of the course, we will focus on data exploration. The course will focus on data tasks you are familiar with from other courses but will emphasize using these summary measures to understand what's happening in your data. During this phase of the course, you will have several relatively short homework exercises, but will spend most of your time working on understanding a dataset of your own choosing. 
    
    + No class Wednesday (Thanksgiving Break)
    

- Final projects due on the last day of exams
