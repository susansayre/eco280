## Section 1: Economic Literature

In the first part of the course, we will spend our Monday class sessions learning/reviewing the three software tools we will use in this class: R, Stata, and Git and our Wednesday class sessions focused on searching, reading, and writing about the economic literature. Weekly computer homework exercises will be handed out each Monday and will be due the following Monday. During this phase of the course, each student will write a synthetic review of the economic literature on a topic of your choosing.

### Week 1 (8/31 - 9/4)
Course Intro and Software Setup

#### Wed 9/2
Introduction to class

### Week 2 (9/7 - 9/11)
Searching the literature/Git

#### Mon 9/7 

**Read** [Bryan, J. (2018). Excuse me, do you have a moment to talk about version control?. The American Statistician, 72(1), 20.](http://sfxhosted.exlibrisgroup.com/smith?sid=google&auinit=J&aulast=Bryan&atitle=Excuse%20me%2C%20do%20you%20have%20a%20moment%20to%20talk%20about%20version%20control%3F&title=The%20American%20Statistician&volume=72&issue=1&date=2018&spage=20&issn=0003-1305)

**Prepare** by starting [HW 1](homework/hw1-git-basics). You do **not** need to finish the homework and class will be used for troubleshooting and other questions.

#### Wed 9/9

**Read** [Almond, D. (2018). Childhood circumstances and adult outcomes: Act II. *Journal of Economic Literature*, 56(4), 1360.](http://sfxhosted.exlibrisgroup.com/smith?sid=google&auinit=D&aulast=Almond&atitle=Childhood%20circumstances%20and%20adult%20outcomes%3A%20Act%20II&title=Journal%20of%20Economic%20Literature&volume=56&issue=4&date=2018&spage=1360&issn=0022-0515)

**Discussion**  Paper structure, how the authors engage with other economimc literature. Pay close attention to how they organized the papers, what they tell us about each paper, and the language they use in discussing the papers.

**Activity** Searching the literature

### Week 3 (9/14 - 9/18)

Summarizing economic papers, workflow

#### Mon 9/14

**Submit** [HW 1](homework/hw1-git-basics)

**Activity** Begin work on [HW 2](homework/hw2-regressions-w-code)
        
#### Wed 9/16

**Submit** an RMarkdown document to your lit-review repo describing your search of the literature on a topic of your choosing. You should describe the process you followed and include a list of at least five papers. The papers should represent different phases of your literature search (that is, you should not simply report the first five papers that come up when you enter a search term). For each paper, include a complete citation in APA format and a brief assessment of the journal (or other location) in which the paper appears. You do *not* need to summarize the papers themselves.

**Activity** Reading skills: abstract, introduction, and conclusion; focused reading of data and methods

**Start** Constructing a summary of your chosen article (due Wed 9/23)

### Week 4 (9/21 - 9/25)

Classifying the literature

#### Mon 9/21
**Submit** [HW 2](homework/hw2-regressions-w-code)

**Activity** begin work on HW 3

#### Wed 9/23

**Submit** paper summary
**Activity** classifying the literature

### Week 5 (9/28 - 10/2)

Literature presentations, live or asynchronous
[Literature review](papers/lit-review) due next Wed 10/7

#### Mon 9/28
**Submit** HW 3

## Section 2: Reproducible research

In this part of the course, we focus on developing good practices for reproducible research. You work will consist of a mix of homework exercises and interim progress checkpoints on your group project to reproduce the analysis in an existing economic journal article. I will provide a list of suggested articles to reproduce.

### Week 6 (10/5 - 10/9) Organization

- File and folder structure
- Relative paths, collaboration with others
- Storing raw data
- Data manipulation with code

#### Wed 10/7

**Submit** [literature review](papers/lit-review)
    
- Data wrangling

    + Creating new variables from existing ones (mutate, gen)
    + Computing summary statistics by group (summarize, collapse)
    + Reorganizing data (pivot, reshape)
    + Merging data from different sources (xxx_join, merge)
    
    Key point: Before you start to write code, first determine what your data looks like now **and** what you want it to look like. Then plan the steps you need to get from one to the other.
    
- Working with strings and dates  
- Implementing regression methods with code
- Creating output with code

## Section 3: Understanding your data

In this part of the course, we will focus on data exploration. The course will focus on data tasks you are familiar with from other courses but will emphasize using these summary measures to understand what's happening in your data. During this phase of the course, you will have several relatively short homework exercises, but will spend most of your time working on understanding a dataset of your own choosing. 
    
    + No class Wednesday (Thanksgiving Break)
    

- Final projects due on the last day of exams
