## Section 1: Economic Literature

In the first part of the course, we will spend our Monday class sessions learning/reviewing the three software tools we will use in this class: R, Stata, and Git and our Wednesday class sessions focused on searching, reading, and writing about the economic literature. Weekly computer homework exercises will be handed out each Monday and will be due the following Monday. During this phase of the course, each student will write a synthetic review of the economic literature on a topic of your choosing.

#### Wed 9/16

**Submit** an RMarkdown document to your lit-review repo describing your search of the literature on a topic of your choosing. You should describe the process you followed and include a list of at least five papers. The papers should represent different phases of your literature search (that is, you should not simply report the first five papers that come up when you enter a search term). For each paper, include a complete citation in APA format and a brief assessment of the journal (or other location) in which the paper appears. You do *not* need to summarize the papers themselves.

**Activity** [Reading skills: abstract, introduction, and conclusion](https://eco280smith.netlify.app/materials/activities/aic-method); focused reading of data and methods

**Start** Constructing a summary of your chosen article (due Wed 9/23)

### Week 4 (9/21 - 9/25)

Classifying the literature
