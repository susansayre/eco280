## Course Description

The course is designed to prepare students to conduct their own economic research or to work as part of research team. The course emphasizes practical research skills that complement existing coursework on economic theory and econometric methods. We focus on two main areas: effective strategies for searching, reading, and synthesizing the economic literature and practical data management, documentation, and wrangling skills.

This course will be especially useful for students interested in conducting original research as part of a special studies or honors project, for those who want to work as a research assistant while at Smith, and for those interested in graduate programs or research oriented positions in economics after Smith. At the end of the course, you will able to:

- Conduct a thorough search of the economic literature on a topic to identify high quality, relevant papers in a particular area
- Summarize the findings of economic research papers
- Synthesize the body of work on a topic, identifying common themes, areas of agreement or disagreement, and different methodological approaches
- Acquire, manage, and work with data from a wide variety of sources
- Manage data and code effectively to ensure reproducible research
- Develop a step-by-step plan for producing outcomes of interest from your data
- Implement the plan effectively in statistical software (R and Stata)
- Use Git/GitHub to share work with peers and document the development of your computer code

## Class Zoom Sessions

We will have synchronous Zoom sessions on MW from 10:55am-12:10pm EST. Use [this Zoom link](https://smith.zoom.us/j/96396536926) to join our sessions. I encourage but do not require you to have your camera on if you are joining live. When you join, you will need to sign in to you Zoom account and will be put in the waiting room. Please use your Smith zoom account so that I know who you are and can let you in promptly.

Class sessions in this course will be a mix of presentation of methods and time for students to experiment and practice the techniques introduced. To the extent practical, I will aim to have the presentation of methods available asynchronously and use synchronous sessions for hands-on activities that can also be replicated by students who are unable to attend synchronously. Any parts of class that involve presentation of methods will be recorded and posted for asynchronous students to access. Depending on the specifics of the activity, hands-on activities may or may not be recorded, but directions for completing the actitivies asynchronously will be available.

During most class Zoom meeting, I encourage you to use Slack rather than Zoom chat for asking questions. This works better when we're using breakout rooms as we can all still communicate over Slack. Moreover, our discussion will be archived on Slack for later reference.

In some cases, we may have a class "meeting" over Slack if we are primarily working on an individual activity. In this case, I will post the class activity on Slack and will be available throughout the class meeting to answer questions on Slack and/or connect briefly over video if you have a more in depth question. How often we connect live over Zoom or "meet" via Slack is open to discussion as a group.

In addition to class sessions, each student will be part of a study group. These groups will be formed based on a mix of time availability, programming experience in R and Stata, and estimates of how often you'll be able to attend class synchronously. The goal is for students participating primarily asynchronously to have a regular meeting time to work through class activities with other peers who are also primarily participating asynchronously. If you anticipate having a schedule that is too irregular to accommodate this, please contact me so that we can identify a workable approach for you to complete class activities.

## Assessment

- 40% Homework exercises
- 20% Literature review
- 20% Paper replication
- 20% Final project

40% of your course grade will be based on regular homework exercises focused primarily on developing practical data skills. In addition, you will complete three papers in the course: a synthetic review of the economic literature on a topic of your choosing, a fully documented replication of an existing economic research project (done in groups), and a fully documented and reproducible **descriptive** data analysis on a topic of your own choosing. You will present a brief summary of both your literature review and your data analysis to the class.

## Software

This course will use two software tools extensively: R/RStudio and Git/GitHub. These are the tools I use regularly in my own research and their integration provides valuable economies of scale. While we will default to using R, the course will also cover Stata programming given its frequent use in economics. We will emphasize the *process* of programmatic data analysis over expertise in a specific language. You will have one homework exercise that will ask you to complete the same task in *both* R and Stata and will have a choice of software for several other assignments.

## Late work and flexibility

The official late policy for the course is that late work will be penalized 5% of the grade for each 24 hours or portion thereof late. However, I recognize that remote learning creates additional challenges for all of us. My experience is that having specific deadlines can help keep you on track with your learning, so the due dates and official late policy will remain in effect. At the same time, I am open to granting extensions if needed. To help keep the deadlines "real", you need to contact me before the due date if you believe you'll need an extension. In general, you do not need to provide a detailed description of why you need an extension, but if you are regularly having trouble meeting the course deadlines, I may ask you to set up a meeting to discuss how I can help you stay on track. Since I have set aside specific times for grading, assignments turned in late will be graded last and may receive feedback noticeably later than other classmates.

## Office hours

I will have regular Zoom office hours at two times TBD based on student schedules during the week. I strongly encourage you to come and ask questions about any course material you have questions about or anything else you'd like to discuss. I am also available by appointment at other times.

## Academically engaged time
As you may know, college guidelines suggest that students should spend roughly 12 hours per week on a 4 credit class like this one. For this class, 3 of those hours each week will be in class, leaving 9 hours outside of class. While recognizing that students need different amounts of time to accomplish different tasks, you might find these suggestions helpful in considering how to use that time:

- ~1 hr each week preparing for class sessions by reading articles and/or software tutorials in advance
- 2-4 hrs each week working on the paper associated with the current course section
- 4-6 hrs each week working on the homework exercises

Note that these breakdowns will shift to some degree over the course of each unit in the course. During the first part of a unit, your time should be more focused on the homework exercises. These will taper off at the end of each unit to make space for focusing on your paper.

## A note on scheduling and flexibility

As we all learned last spring, remote coursework raises a number of challenges, many of which are related to schedule. I anticipate that students will be participating in this course from a wide variety of time zones. As a result, I will plan the material so that students are able to participate asynchronously. Groups for group work in the course will be arranged using time availability as a primary criterion. If you have other constraints on your time availability that you think may affect your work in this class, please let me know.

The primary constraint on my availability is my childcare responsibilities. I have two children, who are in first and third grade. Their school will be remote for at least the first part of the semester and potentially the whole semester. The specifics of their schedule are still evolving, but there will be blocks of time during the week in which I will be unavailable as I'll be supervising their school work. I will also generally be unable to answer email or schedule appointments from 5-8:30pm EST. Given time zone challenges, I anticipate scheduling at least one or two evening times when I will be available for questions.

## Slack

The primary forum for communication in this class will be our [Slack workspace](http://smi-eco280-02-202101.slack.com/). Please use the #questions channel to post general questions about class and the assignment specific channels (e.g. #hw1) to ask questions about particular assignments. Please look through the Slack history and the course materials on the class website briefly before posting to see if your question is answered there. Unless your question is personal, I ask that you post in the public channel so that everyone can benefit from each others' questions and answers. I also **strongly** encourage you to answer your classmates' questions if you can. As a general rule, you can learn as much about programming from helping others as you do from completing exercises yourself.

If you have personal questions, my preference is that you send a direct message to me on Slack, but you can also email me at ssayre\@smith.edu.

If at any point in the semester, you have trouble accessing Slack, please let me know. Email is best, but I have also created a forum on our Moodle site where you can post a message in case you are having trouble with email as well.

## Academic Honesty

As in any other course at Smith, you are required to adhere to the provisions of the Honor Code. I take academic honesty very seriously and will report any suspected violations of the Honor Code to the Honor Board.

I encourage you to work together on the homework exercises in the course, but each student must complete their own work. Directly copying work from a classmate or allowing your own answers to be copied is a violation of the honor code. You should understand what any code you submit as your work does. If you have any questions about how the honor code applies in the context of homework, please come see me.
