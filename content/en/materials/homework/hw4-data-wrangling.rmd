## Learning objectives

This homework is designed to give you practice working with five basic data wrangling tasks. There are many tutorials online describing the "five main verbs" of `dplyr` (which is part of the `tidyverse`) that show how to accomplish these tasks in R using dplyr/tidyverse. This homework asks you to complete the tasks in both R and Stata. The five basic operations and associated commands are:

```{r five verb table, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}
tabl <- "  
| Data task                   | dplyr commands           | Stata commands           |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| choosing/renaming variables | select, rename, relocate | keep, drop, rename, order|
| sorting data                | arrange                  | sort                     |
| subsetting data             | filter                   | keep if, drop if         |
| creating/modifying variables| mutate                   | gen, replace, egen       |
| computing summary statistics| summarize                | summary, collapse        |
"
cat(tabl) 
```
